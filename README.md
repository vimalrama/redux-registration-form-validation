A not-so-straight-forward example of a using Redux-Form's SyncValidation to validate a form with nested levels (`FormSection`s), while showing errors on both the top and the bottom levels, and manually triggering validation by dispatching a redux action.

The requirements are deceptivley simple. The form should validate that a user added his name, a valid email, and at least one bank account.

At first glance, one might want to use a nested form to enter the bank account details. But Redux-Form does not support nested forms.

Instead, Redux-Form has a concept of [`FormSection`](https://redux-form.com/7.0.4/docs/api/formsection.md/)s, which is quite nice, except that [it does not support validation](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/2150).

On top of that, Redux-Form's [SyncValidation does not provide an api to manually trigger validation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40886568/how-to-re-trigger-validations-manually-in-reduxform). Which we will need at various points in our app.

The example takes advantage of Redux-Form's SyncValidation, and redux-form-material-ui components, while customizing the validation to match the requirements.

The code is well-commented. The `bankAccounts` virtual field is used to display an error on the top level component, it validates using the props received from the redux state. We use another virtual field `validate` to manually trigger validation at various points. Then the submit function combines the values generated by redux-form and the bankAccounts from the redux-state to create the final output.
